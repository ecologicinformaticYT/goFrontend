goFrontend is a fronted server for HTML websites (made with HTML/JavaScript/CSS & some images).
It doesn't support any other language.

To host a site on your PC with goFrontend, put it's files into goFrontend_<branch>/<your_OS>/site/user (the user folder is the root of the website),
then start the server using .exe/.bat (Windows) or .sh (Linux/Debian). You can delete the files that are already there, as they are just examples.

ST : Single-Threaded branch
MT : Multi-Threaded branch

To see a page type <your-domain-name-or-localhost>/<path-to-page> (don't forget to precise the file extension) in your browser's address bar, then click "Enter".
